# c-base-converter

Plugin for Sublime Text 3.

Allows conversion of C and C++ [integer literals](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/integer_literal) between different bases.

C currently only has support for binary literals via a [GNU extension](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Binary-constants.html).
C++ supports binary literals as of [C++14](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2012/n3472.pdf).
